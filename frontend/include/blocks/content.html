        <p class="text-uppercase">The Kuril Islands or Kurile Islands in Russia's Sakhalin Oblast region, form a
            volcanic archipelago that
            stretches approximately 1,300 km (810 mi) northeast from Hokkaido, Japan, to Kamchatka, Russia,
            separating the Sea of Okhotsk from the North Pacific Ocean</p>
        <p>All the islands are currently under Russian jurisdiction. Japan claims the two southernmost large islands
            (Iturup and Kunashir) as part of its territory, as well as Shikotan and the Habomai islets, which has
            led to the ongoing Kuril Islands dispute. The disputed islands are known in Japan as the country's
            "Northern Territories"</p>
        <h3>Geography</h3>
        <p>The Kuril Islands form part of the ring of tectonic instability encircling the Pacific Ocean referred to
            as the Ring of Fire. The islands themselves are summits of stratovolcanoes that are a direct result of
            the subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Okhotsk Plate, which forms the Kuril Trench some 200
            kilometres (120 mi) east of the islands. The chain has around 100 volcanoes, some 40 of which are
            active, and many hot springs and fumaroles. </p>

            <p>Those inhabitants however, though theyâ€™ve quite a bit to be disgruntled about, are exceptionally
                good-natured. Perhaps it comes from having to get along and help one another in this harsh
                environment.</p>

        <h3>List of main islands</h3>
        <p>While in Russian sources the islands are mentioned for the first time in 1646, the earliest detailed
            information about them was provided by the explorer Vladimir Atlasov in 1697. </p>
